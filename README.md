# Cr4ackme

This is a source code for [https://crackmes.one/crackme/6182052d33c5d4329c345484]

Or you can compile the souce code by yourself.

 ```
 gcc f_crackme.c -o crackme
 ```

When making this crakcme, my lovely Windows Defender detects it as Trojan.

I just want to prove that this crackme is not harmful at all.

I'm not good at C language so this code might look ugly to some people but at lease it works fine as crackme challenge :)
